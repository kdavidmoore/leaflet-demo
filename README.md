# Leaflet Demo

Demo of leaflet.js

### Note:
You will need a public access token from Mapbox to use this app. Store your access token under assets/js/mapboxApi.js like so:
```javascript
const pubAccessToken = 'myPublicAccessTokenString';
```
You will also need to go to the [Mapbox Editor](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/classic/projects/) and create a new project. Also store the project ID in mapboxApi.js:
```javascript
const projectId = 'myMapboxEditorProjectId';
```
